# Nosylos is the open-source plaform for you to develop all the skill you want

NoSylos provides the framework for you to learn at your own pace, including:
- highly customizable skill tree, you can define what skills, in what order and how much effort you deem as progress
- storyboard, you can sketch your project ideas fast andd get to learning
- project tracker; we believe you learn better by having a project that interests you and see what skills you need to accomplish it

We want NoSylos to be a positive addition to your creative workflow and provide an easier option for tracking progress in your skill development journey (which, hopefully, will never end, there are always more interesting skill to gather). Please share your feedback, this is also your tool.
